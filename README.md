Another simple password generator

This is a command-line application for generating passwords, which has various settings such as selecting the password length, defining a set of common and special characters to be used in the password, and determining the sparsity of special characters compared to batches of common characters. It also has the ability to write the generated password to the clipboard, log actions to a file.

Long ago, I got tired of popular password generators creating passwords in an unattractive and completely random manner. Often, some special characters used in a password were not accepted by the applications for which the password was created. Additionally, there were frequent occurrences where special characters were written consecutively, while in the rest of the password they were absent altogether. This led me to the idea of creating my own password generator where these shortcomings would be addressed. Over time, the program gained more options, and at some point, I decided to release it to everyone in GitHub.
